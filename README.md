# Wildlife-detection-using-deep-learning
This project aims to tackle the critical issue of wildlife conservation by employing state of the art deep learning techniques. Leveraging the YOLOv4 algorithm, we have developed a robust system capable of detecting various wildlife species in images and video streams.
